First cell type sets and aml subtypes taken from Van Galen et al., Cell, 2019

-> 6 subtypes of AML
Potentially a problem: these are very close to their respective normal cell counterparts, e.g. GMP-like is close to the GMP cells (granulocyte macrophage progenitor)

First test: inlcude normal HSCs, GMPs, Myeolid cells as major types -> if too close, adaptation needed, e.g. first distnguish malignant cells, then subtype

Immune types to be epected (according to the Van Galen paper):
In BM biopsies:
- naive T cells, NK cells, CTLs
- in healthy samples: Plasma cells, B cells, T cells, CTLs, NK cells, late and early Erythroid progenitors, pDCs, cDCs

Subtypes: use mel Tcells in the beginning, NK cells, and naive CD4 can be called as subtypes. CTLs not clear yet
